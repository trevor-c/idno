ref: _bson-deserialization
content: |
  .. note::
      
      {{method}} does not
      yet support a ``typeMap`` option for BSON deserialization of the
      returned document. 
      
      Classes implementing
      :php:`MongoDB\\BSON\\Persistable <class.mongodb-bson-persistable>`
      are deserialized according to the :php:`persistance
      <mongodb.persistance>` specification.

## Installation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/idno/Known.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/idno/Known)

### One-click Known sites

If you want to install on your own web space, we recommend [Reclaim Hosting](https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/aff.php?aff=013),
which includes one-click Known installation. Known is also known to work on [DreamHost](https://dreamhost.com), a high-quality
web hosting provider.

### Installing

Known is under active development and requires PHP 7+ with selected extensions, together with a supported database backend.

If you are installing Known for use on your own website, we _highly_ recommend using the installable packages
from <https://withknown.com/opensource>. Installation will be much easier!

You can also opt to check out the bleeding edge code from the git repository: <https://github.com/idno/Known>
